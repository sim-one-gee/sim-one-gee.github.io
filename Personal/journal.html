<h1>Inspiring Site:</h1>
    <br/>

 <a href="http://thatschic.net" target="_blank">thatschic.net</a>

    
    <p>
    This website is very visually interesting without feeling cluttered or difficult to navigate.
    I like that scrolling down brings you a diffrernt landing page that follows the same theme but had a different feeling.
    Because you dont need to travel to each page through a link to see the information within each area. 
    That way you can keep scrolling to decide if you want to travel elsewhere first.</p>

<h1>Project One Ideas:</h1>
    <br/>

     <p>
   For project one I want to create a tonal sight for the goddess Venus. Using images from ancient roman sculptures
for imagery. The text and images with share the same color in common. Text and images with float around the site and 
have a scrolling style. I hope the site feels airy and stylized whith inofrmation being discovered as you scroll. </p>

<h1>Two Sites you would do over:</h1>

<a href="https://www.champagnepoetry.biz" target="_blank">Champagne Poetry </a> 
<a href="https://www.loyly.net" target="_blank">Loyly </a>
<br/>
 <p>This site is one that I use often because I work at Loyly. This site has a genereally nice apperance but the content is not the easiest to navigate and understand. 
    I think better organization and more sections with information could help the site with with navigation. I would use larger images with more of a scroll to learn about the different
services that are offered. The images were just update thankfully so using those images would still be perfect. Maybe some hover could also help with experience on the site. </p>

<h1>Week 9: journal entry</h1>

<a href="https://builtbycivilization.com" target="_blank">Civilization</a>
<br/>

<p>This site by Civilization has an interesting navigation screen. The divisons of links are unlike any I have 
    every seen on a sight before.
    I like it's organized and how it takes up the whole screen. It makes all of the information to navigate 
    very easy to understand, and when you hover over elements like instagram or address, you can see the information right there 
    in the navigation. I like how clicking those links also brings you to the website, or to google maps to show you exactly what it is.

<h1> Journal prompt: Old sckoooling it</h1>

    myspace is the ultimate nostalgia for me. This is my first awareness of coding, and I had to use it in order to 
    customize my page. And boy would I. These ecamples are a little crazy but the general idea is there. Images over images with a basic layout. 
</p>

<p>
    This space jam site also reminds me a sites I visited earlier on. The star background in particular and the 
    blocky images. These sites would load from the top and appear eventually while it took forever to load. 
    I couldn't wait to get on the internet and I was lucky that my dad was also interested. But I remember visiting sites like this with images on top of images.
