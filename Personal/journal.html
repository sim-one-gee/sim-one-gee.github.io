    This website is very visually interesting without feeling cluttered or difficult to navigate.
    I like that scrolling down brings you a diffrernt landing page that follows the same theme but had a different feeling.
    Because you dont need to travel to each page through a link to see the information within each area. 
    That way you can keep scrolling to decide if you want to travel elsewhere first.</p>
